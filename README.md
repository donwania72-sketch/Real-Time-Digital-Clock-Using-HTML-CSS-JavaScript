# Real-Time Digital Clock Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

## Description

This project is a simple and responsive **digital clock** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It displays the current time in real-time and updates every second. The design is clean and easy to customize, making it suitable for beginners learning front-end web development.

## Features

* Real-time clock that updates every second
* Uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries)
* Clean and responsive UI
* Easy to understand and modify

## Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Structure of the clock
* **CSS** – Styling and layout
* **JavaScript** – Time logic and real-time updates

## How It Works

JavaScript fetches the current system time using the `Date` object. The time is formatted (hours, minutes, seconds) and displayed on the webpage. The `setInterval()` function updates the time every second to keep the clock accurate.

## File Structure

```
/clock-project
│── index.html
│── style.css
│── script.js
│── README.md
```

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the project.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. The clock will start automatically.

## Customization

* You can change colors, fonts, or layout from `style.css`.
* You can modify time format (12-hour or 24-hour) in `script.js`.

## Learning Outcome

* Understanding DOM manipulation
* Working with JavaScript `Date` object
* Using `setInterval()` for real-time updates
* Improving HTML/CSS structure and styling
